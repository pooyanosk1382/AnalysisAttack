# What do we do?
First we encrypt a text by substitution cipher. Then we count the number of letters in some books. Also do it for some combination of letters like '__the__', '__and__', '__th__', '__in__', '__ing__', '__ee__', etc.

Then we do same on cipher text and count letters and all combinations of the cipher text, then we compare two analisyses and find the real value of each cipher letter.
